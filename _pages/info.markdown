GWP Medical will provide a paramedic-led ambulance service from 08:00 – 15:00 on site should there be any medical needs. 

A defibrillator can be found at the club house.

## Matches
The festival will be played as a round-robin playing opportunity where equal team and player participation is the emphasis.  Scores will not be recorded and therefore winning does not affect your on-going participation as every team plays the same appropriate number of matches.  There are no winners/runners-up trophies.

Parents are welcome to support all players, but please remain off the pitches and behind the ropes where applicable.
