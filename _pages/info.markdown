## First Aid
It is expected that all squads will have at least 1 qualified First Aider (EFARU or equivalent).
GWP Medical will provide a paramedic-led ambulance service from 08:30 – 15:00 on site should there be any medical needs. 

A defibrillator can be found at the club house.

## Matches
The festival will be played as a round-robin format. Matches will not be scored, instead the focus is on player participation, rugby skills, enjoyment and the RFU’s TREDS core values.

Each club in each age group will be asked to vote for the team showing the best Spirit of Rugby according to the RFU’s core principles of TREDS: a Spirit of Rugby trophy will be awarded at the end of each age group's matches. Additionally, participant medals will be presented to all players.

Please respect the RFU’s Half Game Rule and age grade best practice of fielding teams of mixed ability. 

Every effort will be made to ensure suitable gaps between games (ie to minimise or remove back-to-back games) to allow rest and time for the players to have refreshments.

Parents are welcome to support all players, but please remain off the pitches during play and please allow space along the touchlines for coaches, line markers and most importantly for player and spectator safety.

## Refereeing
As with previous year’s, matches will be refereed by the first named team in a fixture. As such, it is anticipated that each Club will provide a competent referee for each team entered.

## Safeguarding
We follow the RFU [safeguarding guidelines](https://www.englandrugby.com/governance/safeguarding){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
Our Club Safeguarding Officer will be present on the day if there are any concerns.

Players should play within their individual age grade by default. 

**Please let BoARFC know in advance if you have any players playing over or under the stated age for the age group or have any combined age groups, and that you have the relevant CB / RFU approvals as per Regs 15.2 - 15.5.**

## Photography
During the day there will be official photographers taking images of the players during their matches. If you do not wish for your child to be photographed please alert us before the matches commence.

There will be a wide range of food and drinks available on the day including the club BBQ, cake/sweet stalls, the clubhouse for breakfast rolls, wood fired pizza, Mac’n’Cheese, slushies and ice cream. Hot drinks will be available in the club house and additional coffee vans amongst the pitches, and the clubhouse bar will be open.
