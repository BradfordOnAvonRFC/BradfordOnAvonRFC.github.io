    A family-run golf, events, corporate, and dining venue set in the beautiful Wiltshire countryside just outside Bath. 

    Cumberwell Park is family-run, and everyone is assured of a warm welcome. The owners previously farmed the land and remain actively involved with the running of the business.

    Utilizing the natural features and landscape of the Wiltshire countryside, the original 18 holes opened in September 1994, namely the red and yellow courses. A mixture of woodland and parkland, it was a great starting point for Cumberwell Park's 4-star golf complex.

    The clubhouse was built in the style of a traditional Wiltshire barn, containing the Spikes Bar and [Pro-Shop](https://cumberwell-park.squarespace.com/golf/pro-shop). The upstairs has become a successful [function suite](https://cumberwell-park.squarespace.com/functions) hosting a variety of functions such as Dinners, Conferences, Parties, and Sunday Lunches.

    The addition of 9 holes, namely the blue course, in 1999 featured predominantly a mixture of challenging water holes.

    July 2007 saw the opening of a further 9 holes, known as the orange course, a links-style downland course with panoramic views of the Wiltshire countryside, completing this [ideal golfing venue](https://cumberwell-park.squarespace.com/golf).
